# Olympic Data Visualization

## Overview

This project provides visualizations of Olympic athlete data, focusing on three main aspects:
1. An overview of Olympic athletes by age and height.
2. The distribution of medals among the top 15 countries.
3. The number of countries participating in the Olympics over the years.

## Scenes

### Scene 1: Olympic Athletes Overview

The height of each bar indicates the total number of medals earned by the country. Hover over the segments to see the exact number of each type of medal earned by the country.


### Scene 3: Olympic Participation by Year
This scene shows the number of countries participating in the Olympics for each year, with separate lines for summer and winter games.
